Whats **http_monitor**
**********************
A small script written to monitor some services running on my server. The goal was to have the status reflected in my desktop's status bar which is running `py3status <https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. If you're running **i3**, **py3status** and have some services (or websites) you'd like to monitor feel free to use this module.

Where to download
*****************

The script is available on `github <https://github.com/mcgillij/http_monitor>`_ along with the installation directions.
