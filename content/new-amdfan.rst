New release cut
***************

I cut a new releases of both `amdfan <https://github.com/mcgillij/amdfan>`_ and `py3status-amdfan <https://github.com/mcgillij/py3status-amdfan>`_ on the weekend. Mostly due to updated dependency changes in Arch.

Since *py3status-amdfan* depends on amdfan for reading the GPU fan rpms and temperature, it needed to be updated as well to point to the new version of amdfan.


AUR
***

Both AUR's are updated and can be found here:

- `AMDFAN 0.1.11 <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/amdfan/>`_
- `py3status-amdfan 0.1.1 <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/py3status-amdfan/>`_

PyPi
****

Updates were also pushed to PyPi if you happen to be running either of these through there as well.
