*************************************

Great question! Tired of missing your github notifications in i3wm? Sorry am bad at sales pitches...

It's a small Python module I wrote to show github notifications in your **i3bar** with py3status.

There were other modules that did this but they |ss| were terrible |se|  didn't do what I wanted, or required passing in plain text passwords etc |ss| and sucked real bad |se|.

How to use it?
