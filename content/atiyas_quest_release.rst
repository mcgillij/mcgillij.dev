Atiya's Quest Release
*********************

Finally I'm releasing the game I've been working on for the last several months.

It is available now `Linux <https://github.com/mcgillij/AQ/releases/download/0.1.2/AQ_linux_0.1.2.tar.gz>`_, `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.mcgillij.ymbag>`_ and `Windows <https://github.com/mcgillij/AQ/releases/download/0.1.2/AtiyasQuest.0.1.2.7z>`_.

It's a match-3 puzzle style game featuring my dog Atiya.

Free to play, no ads, no in-app purchases, no data collection. Just a game. Hope you have fun!

Note: The android release is pending the google store publishing process and should be available soon.
