Launch day for Elden Ring! It's out and finally unlocked and playable in Linux
day one (with the caveat that only offline mode works due to the garbage software
that is EAC).

Here's how to get it working.

Navigate to your Elden Ring directory

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game/
   cp eldenring.exe start_protected_game.exe

Launch the game and enjoy Elden Ring in offline mode.

Hopefully FROM with some pressure from Valve get EAC working in Linux properly through
Proton, or at least give us the option to play without this garbage software.

That's it, if you need to revert to the EAC protected version just re-validate your game in steam.
