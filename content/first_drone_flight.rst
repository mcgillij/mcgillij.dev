Last week I got myself a drone, more on the specifics later. And I brought it out with me off-roading on the weekend.

My goals were to not crash the drone on my first flight screwing around with it. And I'm glad to say that it was a success!

Drone in question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I picked up a `dji mini 3 pro <https://www.dji.com/ca/mini-3-pro>`_. I'm not yet super into all the drone specs.

The main selling point for me was that it was a mini drone (under 250g, so that there's no headache requiring me to register it etc).

Geofencing
^^^^^^^^^^

It has built-in geofencing, so in theory I won't be getting myself into trouble for flying it.

However there are some extra necessities in regards to flying a drone in Canada that aren't taken into account by the built-in geofencing.

Checking the `NRC Drone flight map <https://nrc.canada.ca/en/drone-tool/flightMap.php>`_ site or app prior to flying.

So far I've only done one flight, so it hasn't been a huge hassle. There's also ways to ask for exemptions from the geofencing, but I'm not that concerned about wanting to try to fly it in restricted areas honestly. This is mostly just for me to mess around in the woods.

My first flight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I've uploaded the video to `youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxl-shHZ8HM>`_ of the maiden flight, and you can check it out here if you like.

I can't wait to take it out again and start messing with more features, but I'll probably hold off on the **sports** mode.
Since it disables all the flight assist stuff and object-avoidance, since I don't really want to crash it into a tree just yet.
