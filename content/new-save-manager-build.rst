New features?
*************

Not really any new features, now the user will be left to only do backups when the game isn't running, as the process check was interfering with saving the game with Noita Together running.

Now this check is disabled, and the dependencies have been update, and I've rolled out a new Windows build for those interested.

This issue was raised on github, so I figured I'd push up the update and release information.
