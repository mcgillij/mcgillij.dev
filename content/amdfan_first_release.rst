What is AMDFAN
**************

My fork of an abandoned `amdgpu_fan <https://github.com/chestm007/amdgpu-fan>`_ project.

A utility to control or monitor the fan speeds of GPUs in Linux that use the ``amdgpu`` driver.

With security fixes, improvements and features that I couldn't find in any of the alternatives.

Improvements
************

- monitor the fan speeds
- monitor GPU temperatures
- allow manual fan speed
- adjustable frequency
- adjustable temperature threshold
- security fixes
- broken functionality addressed, now able to set system controlled fans
- additional tests and linting

Where to get it?
