Atiya's Quest Website
*********************

Just a quick update, was out most of the labor day weekend visiting my parents, and 
friends. But I did manage to throw together a website for Atiya's Quest.

With the release of Atiya's Quest I have created a website for the game. You can find it at `https://atiyasquest.mcgillij.dev <https://atiyasquest.mcgillij.dev>`_.

You can download the game directly from here: `Linux <https://github.com/mcgillij/AQ/releases/download/0.1.2/AQ_linux_0.1.2.tar.gz>`_, `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.mcgillij.ymbag>`_ and `Windows <https://github.com/mcgillij/AQ/releases/download/0.1.2/AtiyasQuest.0.1.2.7z>`_. Or visit the website for more information.

Make sure to rate the game if you like it!
