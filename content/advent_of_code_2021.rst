Advent of Code 2021
===================

Almost the best part of the year! Since 2015 the advent of code has been a staple
in my December rituals. I've always worked my way through most of the entries, some
years I finished them in time, some others I had family obligations to get to.

However they are a fantastic way to work through some interesting problems, and 
usually I use them to learn a new language or try something different.

This year was no different, the goals I set out with going into the challenge.

- Not build any classes
- Use Copilot and see what happens

There's always a nice story / hidden fun stuff and theme each year. This year 
the theme was submarine, scanners, sonar and sea life. And overall was quite a 
great experience. They do a fantastic job of explaining the problems. 

Each day 1 new problem, and a bonus step.

How did Copilot do?
===================

It started off quite well, the first 2 days it was able to handle the problems
mostly from my comments. But quickly it escalated to lots of errors and it became
an exercise in debugging and code-review. Which is fine I guess, since you get what 
pay for. Overall I do enjoy using Copilot, however I find it most useful in places
where you are having to fill out boilerplate code. Or even just writing documentation.

Below are the links to the challenges and the solutions in `Python <https://python.org>`_.
