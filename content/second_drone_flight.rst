Building some confidence flying the drone, I guess is what I was out there doing.

Just wanted to get a bit of flight time, and try to figure out some more of the functionality of the drone.

It was a nice night out, and I managed to almost drain the battery.

Some photo's and a video

Just about to take off.

Here I was messing around with the panorama mode, and managed to get a half decent shot.

It does look to warp near the bottom, but otherwise looks really nice.
