What is AmdFan?
***************

AMDFan is a fork of `amdgpu_fan <https://github.com/chestm007/amdgpu-fan>`_, with some security fixes, bug fixes and improvements that I made for myself, but I figure some other people may want to use it as well so here we are.

It's available as a PyPI package and Arch User Package.

It supports active monitoring of multiple AMD gpus, as well as applying a fan curve running as a systemd service.

Or you can use it to manually toggle fan speeds or revert to system controlled fan speeds.

Where to get it?
****************

- `github.com/mcgillij/amdfan <https://github.com/mcgillij/amdfan>`_
- `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/amdfan/>`_
- using **pip**, **pipenv** or **poetry** to install it.
- from the `AUR <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/amdfan/>`_, or building your own Arch package (directions on github)
- Debian package **WIP**
