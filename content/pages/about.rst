Like other blogs, I guess I'll put up an about page. I'm a old school hacker living in Halifax. I've been using Linux primarily for work and at home for close to 25 years now.

Here's a few things that I'm interested in:

- Hikes with my dog pictured above (Atiya)
- Playing guitar and bass, collecting old Sunn amplifiers
- Going to heavy metal concerts
- Playing games like DND or video games (especially dwarf fortress)
- Writing small video game demo's (mainly dwarf fortress clones)
- Security and Privacy
