Bayers Lake
===========

It was a nice sunny day today, after taking the Atiya to the dog park we went out to Bayers lake and took the drone out for a quick fly around a couple lake/ponds.

It was quite windy out, and I got several warnings on the controller implying that the auto-return functionality of the drone wouldn't function, however I was able to pilot it back fine manually. Haven't had to use the auto-return yet though, so there's that.

That was it for today, was a nice time out with the doggo.
